# objectivec-cpp-interview-practice
Study sessions to prepare for interviews 

# Objectives
- Mock interviews and coding chalanges 
- Creating a repo of cheatsheets and example code
- Collaborate with others while preparing for the next interview

# Approach
I think we should meet for about 1 hour, each should present a few concepts and a coding challange and/or project. Then we should ask the other about a few concepts and to do a coding challange. We can then commit our work here with a pull request. I am also open to other ideas.

# File Structure
- documents - each user can post their own cheatsheets of concepts here
- src - each user can post their challange here
